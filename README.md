# MrClippy
The rebirth of Karl Paperclip, or affectionately known as Mr. Clippy.
Many of us love or hate the idea of an interactive agent that guides the user through an application. 
Microsoft tried this 20 years ago with Mr. Clippy and gave up after a short time. 
But now he is back as a component for Lazarus.
